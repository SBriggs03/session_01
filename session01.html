  <p>One of my favourite hobbies to do in my spare time is football. i have a
    really strong passion about football as i like to play it and watch it.
    i normally tend to have a happy and content personality and try to stand
     out to other people around me by showing what my abilities can do. In my
     personal life it consists of what my time was like in high school
     and other information that has more of a meaning to me personally.</p>

<p>I like football as i have a really strong and reinforced passion for it as i
have liked this certain sport since i was a little kid. Other professional
footballers with different nationalities inspire me to like the sport even more
than what i do today</p>
